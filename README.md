# NeoLux

NeoLux is a game where players can use their own devices to join a chaotic free-for-all space battle in a vibrant, neon-tinged environment.

## About the Project

NeoLux utilizes Node.js and WebSockets to sync data between players' phones and a central game screen for a unique style of gameplay that brings multiplayer gaming back to its roots. Players can use 4 different types of spaceship modules to construct a unique personal craft, each having their respective advantages and disadvantages. Hull modules protect the ship, engine modules propel the ship, wing modules allow maneuverability, and weapon modules allow players to rain destruction upon anyone else in the room. After each life, players are given the option to change their ship to their liking. The game features realistic collision physics, high-adrenaline gameplay, and dazzling graphics.  

## Playing the Game

A running server for the game can be found with [this link](http://spacegame-hackkstate2018.7e14.starter-us-west-2.openshiftapps.com/). The game will begin by asking if you want to be a screen or a controller. Controllers are required to be a mobile device with gyroscopic capabilities. The screen is the place where all ships can be viewed. If controller is chosen, a ship editor will open. Here you have the ability to customize your ship with various pieces. 

### Ship Pieces

- Hull: Hull pieces add extra health the your ship but also add weight which slows your ship down.
- Engine: Engines increase ship power and decrease turning ability.
- Wings: Wings increase turning ability.
- Weapons: Used to shoot down other players. 

### Controls

- Boost: Press the boost button on the phone to move your ship forward.
- Fire: Press the fire button on the phone to shoot the guns on your ship.
- Turn: Rotate the phone like a steering wheel to turn the ship.
